# chatgpt-tablist
buggy spigot tablist plugin created entirely by chatgpt for 1.19.4. <br>
<br>
The plugin also does not seem to load the tablist everytime a player joins and chatgpt wouldn't give a proper fix so you'll have to run /tablistreload everytime you join the server and I don't want to fix this myself either as I wanted this to be created entirely by chatgpt.
<br>
## WARNING / NOTE
**Not recomended for use with your actual Minecraft server. This plugin is really bad and has a lot of bugs and does not really work correctly this was created entirely for experimental purposes and not meant for use with an actual Minecraft server.**
